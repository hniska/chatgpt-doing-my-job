Write a python script that talks to openai using the openai module, it should get the openai api key from an environment variable. The prompt should be to ask chatgpt to act as a senior developer and write good code, well commented, and also that chatgpt should only reply with the code, nothing else. The script should print the code and then also save it to a file. The filename should be given as an input variable. And also the prompt should include a variable that contains the request for what the code should do

ChatGPT

To write the Python script, you'll first need to make sure you have the `openai` module installed. You can install it using pip:

bashCopy code

`pip install openai`

Then, you can create the Python script as follows:

pythonCopy code

`import os import openai import sys # Get API key from environment variable api_key = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY') # Check if API key is not empty if not api_key: print("Error: OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable is not set.") sys.exit(1) # Set up the OpenAI API client openai.api_key = api_key # Get the filename and task description from the input arguments if len(sys.argv) < 3: print("Usage: python script.py <filename> <task_description>") sys.exit(1) filename = sys.argv[1] task_description = sys.argv[2] # Prepare the prompt for ChatGPT prompt = f"As a senior developer, I am asked to write good, well-commented code to perform the following task: {task_description}. Please provide only the Python code:" # Send the request to ChatGPT response = openai.Completion.create( engine="text-davinci-codex-002", prompt=prompt, max_tokens=200, n=1, stop=None, temperature=0.5, ) # Extract and print the generated code code = response.choices[0].text.strip() print("Generated code:") print(code) # Save the code to a file with open(filename, "w") as f: f.write(code) print(f"\nCode saved to file: {filename}")`

To run the script, provide the filename and task description as command-line arguments:

bashCopy code

`python script.py output_code.py "a function that takes two integers as input and returns their sum"`

Make sure to set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable before running the script:

bashCopy code

`export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key`

![](data:;base64,<svg%20xmlns='[http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' version='1.1' width='38' height='38](http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738 "http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20version='1.1'%20width='38'%20height='38")'/>)![User](file:///Users/hniska/.config/joplin-desktop/resources/87d0b68c644b47e6b3434ade109acfb7.configjoplindesktopt)

I want a python script that uses the dall-e api to generate images for my slide deck. Give me a script that take two arguments, one for the filename and one for the promt, it should of course take the API key from an environment variable.

ChatGPT

To write the Python script for generating images using the DALL-E API, you'll first need to make sure you have the `requests` module installed. You can install it using pip:

bashCopy code

`pip install requests`

Then, you can create the Python script as follows:

pythonCopy code

`import os import sys import requests # Get API key from environment variable api_key = os.getenv('DALLE_API_KEY') # Check if API key is not empty if not api_key: print("Error: DALLE_API_KEY environment variable is not set.") sys.exit(1) # Get the filename and prompt from the input arguments if len(sys.argv) < 3: print("Usage: python script.py <filename> <prompt>") sys.exit(1) filename = sys.argv[1] prompt = sys.argv[2] # Set up the DALL-E API request headers headers = { "Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}", "Content-Type": "application/json", } # Set up the DALL-E API request data data = { "prompt": prompt, "num_images": 1, "size": "256x256", "response_format": "url", } # Send the request to the DALL-E API response = requests.post("https://api.openai.com/v1/images/generations", headers=headers, json=data) # Check if the request was successful if response.status_code != 200: print(f"Error: Failed to generate image. Status code: {response.status_code}") print(response.text) sys.exit(1) # Extract the image URL from the response image_url = response.json()["data"][0]["url"] # Download the image image_response = requests.get(image_url) # Check if the image download was successful if image_response.status_code != 200: print(f"Error: Failed to download image. Status code: {image_response.status_code}") sys.exit(1) # Save the image to a file with open(filename, "wb") as f: f.write(image_response.content) print(f"Image saved to file: {filename}")`

To run the script, provide the filename and prompt as command-line arguments:

bashCopy code

`python script.py output_image.png "Create an image of a Python logo surrounded by automation-related icons such as gears, robots, or flowchart symbols."`

Make sure to set the `DALLE_API_KEY` environment variable before running the script:

bashCopy code

`export DALLE_API_KEY=your_dalle_api_key`

Note that the DALL-E API is not publicly available yet. You'll need to replace the endpoint and API key with the appropriate values when the API becomes available. The example above assumes a hypothetical API endpoint and key.

![](data:;base64,<svg%20xmlns='[http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' version='1.1' width='38' height='38](http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738 "http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20version='1.1'%20width='38'%20height='38")'/>)![User](file:///Users/hniska/.config/joplin-desktop/resources/87d0b68c644b47e6b3434ade109acfb7.configjoplindesktopt)

What could I add to the prompt to get a bit more details and maybe a more futuristic style to the images?

ChatGPT

To get more detailed and futuristic-styled images from DALL-E, you can add specific keywords or phrases to your prompt. Here's an example of a modified prompt:

bashCopy code

`python script.py output_image.png "Create a detailed and futuristic image of a Python logo surrounded by automation-related icons such as gears, robots, or flowchart symbols, with neon lights and a modern, sci-fi aesthetic."`

By including phrases like "detailed," "futuristic," "neon lights," and "modern, sci-fi aesthetic," you're providing more context to DALL-E, which can help guide the image generation process towards a more detailed and futuristic style. Feel free to experiment with different keywords and descriptions to get the desired outcome.

![](data:;base64,<svg%20xmlns='[http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' version='1.1' width='38' height='38](http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738 "http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20version='1.1'%20width='38'%20height='38")'/>)![User](file:///Users/hniska/.config/joplin-desktop/resources/87d0b68c644b47e6b3434ade109acfb7.configjoplindesktopt)
